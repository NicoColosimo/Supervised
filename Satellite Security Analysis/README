# Synthetic Satellite Telemetry Classification

This project generates synthetic multivariate time-series satellite telemetry data and trains a classification model to detect satellite states:

- **0:** Normal behavior  
- **1:** System issue  
- **2:** Compromised system (mixture of normal and anomaly patterns)

## Files

### `generate_satellite_data.py`
- Generates synthetic time-series data for satellite telemetry sensors.  
- Simulates three classes with different noise, drift, and spike patterns.  
- Outputs a CSV file: `synthetic_satellite_data.csv`.

### `train_satellite_model.py`
- Loads and processes the synthetic data.  
- Extracts time-series features by pivoting time steps for each series.  
- Scales features and visualizes with PCA.  
- Trains a CatBoost multiclass classifier.  
- Evaluates with accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix, and cross-validation.  
- Provides threshold adjustment for the "compromised" class.  
- Identifies uncertain predictions via entropy and highlights top feature deviations.

## Usage

Generate synthetic data:

```bash
python generate_satellite_data.py
```

Train and evaluate the model:

```bash
python train_satellite_model.py
```

## Dependencies

- numpy  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- scikit-learn  
- scipy  
- catboost  

Install dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn scipy catboost
```

## Notes

- The synthetic data contains 140 time-series samples (80 normal, 30 system issues, 30 compromised), each with 7 features over 100 time steps.  
- The classification model uses time-series data flattened per satellite and leverages CatBoost for multi-class classification.  
- Uncertainty in predictions is estimated using entropy over predicted probabilities.  
- Results and plots help interpret model performance and identify uncertain cases.
