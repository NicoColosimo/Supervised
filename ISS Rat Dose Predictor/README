# Predicting Mouse Radiation Dose from Spaceflight Exposure Features

This project uses **ridge regression** to predict radiation dose absorbed by mice in spaceflight experiments, based on dosimetry and exposure-related features.

## Target Variables

- `cns_dose_mGy`: Central Nervous System dose (mGy)  
- `skin_dose_mGy`: Skin dose (mGy)  
- `bfo_dose_mGy`: Blood-Forming Organ dose (mGy)

## Files

### `rodent_model.py`
This script:
- Loads experimental data from `Mouse_with_interaction_final.xlsx`
- Compares model performance using:
  - **Base features** (standard exposure/dosimetry)
  - **Extended features** (includes interaction terms)
- Applies **multi-output Ridge Regression** with standardized inputs
- Evaluates model using:
  - Test set **MSE** and **R²** per target
  - **5-fold cross-validation**
  - **Hyperparameter tuning** for Ridge `alpha`
- Produces visualizations:
  - **Predicted vs. True** plots
  - **Residual** plots

## Features

### Base Features (8)
- `log_exposure_duration`  
- `ADR GCR (mGy/d)`  
- `ADR SAA (mGy/d)`  
- `ADR Total (mGy/d)`  
- `TAD GCR (mGy)`  
- `TAD SAA (mGy)`  
- `TAD Total (mGy)`  
- `avg_daily_total_dose`  

### Additional Interaction Terms (6)
- `log_exposure_duration_x_TAD_Total`  
- `ADR_Total_x_TAD_GCR`  
- `TAD_GCR_x_TAD_SAA`  
- `log_exposure_duration_x_TAD_SAA`  
- `TAD_GCR_x_TAD_Total`  
- `TAD_Total_x_avg_daily_total_dose`

## Usage

1. **Prepare the data**  
   Place `Mouse_with_interaction_final.xlsx` in the same directory as the script.

2. **Run the model script**
   ```bash
   python rodent_model.py
   ```

---

## Dependencies

Install required packages with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

---

## Output

- **Evaluation Metrics**
  - MSE and R² scores for each target using both base and extended features
  - Cross-validation results
  - Alpha tuning performance across Ridge regression settings

- **Visualizations**
  - Predicted vs. True plots
  - Residual plots to assess bias and variance

---

## Notes

- The model uses **MultiOutputRegressor** with **Ridge** regression to predict three target variables simultaneously.
- **StandardScaler** is used to normalize input features before training.
- Interaction terms boost model performance by capturing nonlinear relationships.
- This pipeline aids in understanding the biological impact of spaceflight radiation across multiple organ systems.
