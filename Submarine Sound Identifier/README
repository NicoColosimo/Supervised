# Submarine Sounds Simulation and Feature Extraction

This project simulates synthetic submarine acoustic signatures based on different submarine types and extracts audio features using Librosa. It includes characteristics such as harmonics, amplitude modulation, cavitation noise, hydrodynamic band-limited noise, and background noise.

Simulating submarine sounds can help sonar system development, underwater acoustic research, and training machine learning models for underwater object classification.

## Features

- **Submarine Profiles**: Each type (e.g., nuclear, stealth, fast-attack) has its own frequency and modulation characteristics.
- **Signal Generation**: Combines harmonic tones, amplitude modulation, cavitation bursts, and hydrodynamic noise.
- **Noise Layers**:
  - Cavitation pops
  - Band-limited hydrodynamic noise
  - Broadband background noise
- **Feature Extraction**: Computes audio features like:
  - Zero Crossing Rate
  - Spectral Centroid
  - Spectral Bandwidth
  - Spectral Rolloff
  - RMS Energy
  - MFCCs

## Dependencies

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `librosa`

Install with:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas librosa

## Usage

from submarine_sounds import generate_profile_signal_with_noise, extract_audio_features, submarine_profiles, sr

# Choose a submarine profile
profile = submarine_profiles["stealth"]

# Generate sound signal
signal = generate_profile_signal_with_noise(profile, sr=sr)

# Extract audio features
features = extract_audio_features(signal, sr)

# View features as a Pandas Series
import pandas as pd
print(pd.Series(features))
